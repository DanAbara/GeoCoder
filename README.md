## GeoCoder
This application takes in a CSV file which should have a column named 'Address' and generates another CSV with two extra columns holding the latitude and longitudes respectively, of the corresponding adddresses. 
The user is able to download the newly generated CSV.

The web application is built with Flask and the main python script is 
[geoCoder.py](https://github.com/DanAbara/GeoCoder/blob/master/geoCoder.py). The HTML and CSS files are in the 
[templates](https://github.com/DanAbara/GeoCoder/tree/master/templates) and
[static](https://github.com/DanAbara/GeoCoder/tree/master/static) folders respectively.
